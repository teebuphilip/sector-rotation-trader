# Changelog

## 2026-04-21 (session 2 — P0 operational pipeline fixes)

### fix: state.json corruption no longer crashes the daily run
- `portfolio.py:load_state_from` now wraps `json.load()` in try/except for `JSONDecodeError`/`ValueError`.
- On corruption, prints a CRITICAL warning to stderr and falls back to `_default_state()` instead of raising.
- Previously a truncated state file (e.g. mid-write crash) would hard-fail the entire daily run.

Files: `portfolio.py`

### fix: stock data download failure with open positions now aborts instead of continuing silently
- `daily_run.py` previously continued with empty `prices_all` when yfinance failed on stock data.
- Exit signals would never fire (all tickers skipped), positions held indefinitely with no action.
- Now: if download fails and positions are open, exits with code 1. If no positions, continues with entry-only skip as before.

Files: `daily_run.py`

### fix: zero/negative price guard in open_position
- `portfolio.py:open_position` now rejects prices <= 0 before computing shares.
- Prevents `shares = inf` from corrupting state if yfinance returns a bad close price.

## 2026-04-21 (session 1 — crazy idea dedupe + prompt memory)

### feat: deterministic dedupe gate for crazy ideation
- Added `scripts/dedup_crazy_ideas.py` and wired it into the high-action idea pipeline after schema validation and before scoring/publish.
- Duplicate checks now compare the current run, existing algos, and recent idea history using normalized titles, structural fingerprints, and token overlap.
- New artifacts: `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/deduped/` and `data/ideas/runs/YYYY-MM-DD/duplicates/report.json`.
- `scripts/crazy_build_email.py` now reports dedupe keep/remove counts.

### feat: inject existing idea history into generator prompts
- `scripts/crazy_generate_high_action_ideas.py` now appends an `ANTI-DUPLICATE CONTEXT` block to both ChatGPT and Claude prompts.
- That context includes compact existing algo titles plus recent idea titles so the generators see prior work before proposing new ideas.
- This adds prompt-level prevention on top of the deterministic dedupe gate.
